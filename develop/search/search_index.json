In our daily life, we may buy some valuable goods like cars, phones, furniture, etc. All these transactions are preferred to be documented as transfer instead of expenses, otherwise, you cannot evaluate your daily expenses properly. This plugin can generate depreciation transactions automatically. Installing \u00b6 pip install auto-depreciation Configuration \u00b6 The parameters passed to the plugin are: assets : Fixed assets account. expenses : Depreciation expenses account. method : Depreciation method. Parameter default values are as follows: plugin \"auto_depreciation.depreciation\" \"{ 'assets':'Assets:Wealth:Fixed-Assets', 'expenses':'Expenses:Property-Expenses:Depreciation', 'method':'parabola', }\" Usage \u00b6 Xiaoming is a young man. One day he bought a car and paid in cash. We assume that the original value of that car is 100,000 CNY and it will scrap after 10 years. The residual value is still 1,000 CNY. He can use this plugin like this: Example plugin \"auto_depreciation.depreciation\" 2020-03-01 commodity CARS name: \"cars\" assets-class: \"fixed assets\" 2020-03-31 * \"\" Assets:Cash -100000.00 CNY Assets:Wealth:Fixed-Assets 1 CARS {100000.00 CNY, \"BMW\"} useful_life: \"10y\" residual_value: 1000 where we use metadata attached in the posting to pass residual value and useful life to plugin. useful_life is the compulsory item and y represent years while m represent months . residual_value is optional and by default 0.

For example, Straight-line, sum-of-years-digit, Diminishing balance method, etc. Gernerally, the basic depreciation period in accounting is month. That means depreciation expenses of every month are identical if we use straight-line method. However, in this plugin, the basic depreciation period is day and depreciation transactions are generated monthly. That means day is the implicit period when calculating present value, while month is the explicit period to generate transactions. Linear \u00b6 Linear method is the same with straight-line method. The present value of assets vs elapsed days is like this: \\[ y=-\\frac{p-q}{n}x+p \\] where \\(y\\) is the present value, \\(p\\) is the original value, \\(q\\) is the residual value, \\(n\\) is the useful life in days and \\(x\\) is the elapsed time in days.
